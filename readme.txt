Generate multiple Pages using dynamic content.

== Description ==

Page Generator allows you to generate multiple Pages, each with their own variation of a base content template.  

Variations can be produced by using keywords, which contain multiple words or phrases that are then cycled through for each Page that is generated.

Generate multiple Pages in bulk by defining:

* Page Title
* Page Slug / Permalink
* Content
* Publish status (Draft or Publish)
* Number of Pages to generate
* Author
